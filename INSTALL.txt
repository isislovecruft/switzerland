HOW TO INSTALL SWITZERLAND

  sudo python setup.py install

Switzerland is alpha software.  Remarkably, it runs on lots of different
operating systems (we've seen it work on Linux, OS X, BSD and Windows XP), but
because it's alpha software we can't promise that it's easy to install on all
of these operating systems.  It's easiest to install on UNIX systems; Mac OS X
Leopard isn't too hard, but installation on Windows or OS X Tiger is tricky!.
We're looking for volunteers to help with a Windows installer!

Switzerland requires Python 2.4 or later.  Recent Linux operating systems, and
OS X Leopard, should come with Python 2.4.  On OS X Tiger, and on Windows, you
should install Python 2.5.2.  Google it!

Once python is available, there are two things that need to be right for
Switzerland to run: the base directory needs to be in your PYTHONPATH and the
packet sniffing executable (called FastCollector) needs to be compiled and in
your system PATH.

The installer tries to achieve these requirements by hook or by crook.  It may
work for you: cd to the base directory (the one that contains this file), and
run the following command:

  sudo python setup.py install

If sudo doesn't work for you, you can log in as root or Administrator and run
the command without "sudo" at the front.

If you're lucky, that will just work and you can run "switzerland-client" at
the command line.  If not, read on...

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

The Switzerland client may not build/install/work properly unless you have the
following packages on your computer:

python2.4
libpcap          (already installed on some systems, Windows users need WinPcap)
    Windows: http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm
ntp              (not *absolutely* required but operating without it is risky)

    Windows: http://www.meinberg.de/english/sw/ntp.htm#ntp_nt_stable Note
    Windows XP's built-in network time support doesn't seem to work well enough
    for use with switzerland; a third-party ntp daemon such as Meinberg's is
    recommended for reliable operation.  (You may need to run ntpdate to update
    your system clock before ntpd will start synchronizing.)  See the README
    file for more information on how Switzerland uses ntp.
python win32 extensions

The setup.py script tries some precompiled binaries, but if none of those work
on your machine, you will need a basic development environment including a C
compiler and libc-dev and libpcap-dev to compile FastCollector.  The Mac OS X
Developer Tools provide these requirements on Macs, Cygwin can be used to
provide them on Windows.  On Linux, make sure you have gcc and the basic libc
development packages installed.

With all of these prerequisites sorted out, the "python setup.py install"
command should just work for non-Windows systems.  On Windows, you can try 
cd'ing into your switzerland directory and simply running
"python switzerland-client".  If that does not work, you may have to run 
"python setup.py install" or work out how to get FastCollector.c compiled 
and the resulting FastCollector.exe placed somewhere in the PATH.  
Good luck!
