To build and install Switzerland, cd to the base directory (the one that
contains this file), and run the following command:

python setup.py install

You will need to be logged in as root or Administrator.  On Mac OS X, become
root like this:

sudo python setup.py install

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

Switzerland won't install/work properly unless you have the following packages
on your computer:

For the Switzerland client:

python2.5
libpcap            (already installed on most systems)
ntp                (not *absolutely* required but operating without it is risky)

You will either a working pre-compiled copy of the client packet capture
executable (we supply them for some versions of Linux, OS X and Windows) or a
basic development environment including a C compiler and libc-dev and
libpcap-dev.  The Mac OS X Developer Tools can provide these requirements on
Macs, Cygwin can be used to provide them on Windows.

For a Switzerland server:

python2.5

Both the client and server may run faster if you insall the psyco package, but
neither require it.
