Installation requirements:

For Switzerland server:

python2.5

For Alice, the Switzerland client:

python2.5
libpcap
ntp 

Either a pre-compiled copy of the client packet capture binary (we supply one
for OS X and Windows) or a C compiler and libpcap.

On UNIX systems, you can build and install switzerland by running:

make install

as root.  To be root on Mac OS X, try:

sudo make install

Both the client and server may run faster if you insall the psyco package, but
neither require it.
