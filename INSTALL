Installation requirements:

For the Switzerland client:

python2.5
libpcap            (already installed on most systems)
ntp                (not *absolutely* required but operating without it is risky)

You will either a pre-compiled copy of the client packet capture executable
(we may supply one for OS X and Windows) or a basic development environment
including a C compiler and libc-dev and libpcap-dev.  The Mac OS X Developer
Tools can provide these requirements on Macs, Cygwin can provide them on
Windows.

For a Switzerland server:

python2.5

On UNIX systems, you can build and install switzerland by running:

make install

as root.  To be root on Mac OS X, try:

sudo make install

Both the client and server may run faster if you insall the psyco package, but
neither require it.
